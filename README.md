## Design Philosophy - Dev Environment

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Hot Reload should be supported during development

Hot Reload is important for frontend development as the changes can be reflected in a very quick manner. Hot reload feature is already supported by the latest version of Nextjs. Any changes on the source files would trigger rebuilding the application automatically.

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Code Linting is required

Linters are added into this project template to enhance code quality.

## Design Philosophy - Application Design

### ðŸ’¡ Rule: Need a clear layout structure

Every page in the same project actually shares the same structure. I make good use of some Nextjs features and some custom components to organize the pages:

#### app/layout.js

This is provided by the Nextjs framework. It defines root skeleton of any page. For example, it contains markup like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
